        <h1>Welcome to The Anti Net Work Hub</h1>
        <p><strong>I hope you enjoy your stay with me!</strong></p>
        <p>The Anti Network Idea is a few years old, and has become something of an evolving internet art project where I can speak into the void and see if the void speaks back.</p>
        <p>I have strived to give open communication and sharing of art, the good, the bad, and the ugly, for my peers and my self.</p>
        <p>I plan on doing as much as I can for as long as I can, and really feed this Tulpa.<br></p>
        <p>Very soon will have a shop for random things like poetry books, 3d and ink block prints, care packages, maybe even mixtapes (again...)</p>
